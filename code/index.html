    A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application
    for accessing information on the World Wide Web. Each individual web page,
    image, and video is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL),
    enabling browsers to retrieve these resources from a web server and display
    them on a user's device.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are
    often confused. For a user, a search engine is just a website, such
    as google.com, that stores searchable data about other websites. But to
    connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a
    web browser installed on their device.
